# 01 OFFICIAL LOCKED RULES (Bible)

## Non-negotiables
1) One Terminal command per round. Execute -> paste output -> verify -> next.
2) A persistent project board must be maintained and updated every change.
3) Important irreversible rules/decisions must be recorded as Bible docs.
4) Before a window runs out of capacity, produce a perfect handoff pack: ZIP + SHA256, MD + SHA256, and a strict opening prompt for the next window including the next 3 steps.
5) All project contents must be automatically backed up to an external drive.
6) Actively use domestic/international web resources every round to reduce trial-and-error.

## Repo red lines
- Never commit secrets. Put them under configs/secrets/ only.
- All runtime outputs stay under runtime/.
