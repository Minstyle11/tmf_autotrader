# TMF WebSearch Rule Bible v1 (OFFICIAL-LOCKED)

## Rule (Bible-level)
From now on, **EVERY development turn** MUST:
1) Search domestic + international web resources relevant to the current task (and v18 guidance if applicable).
2) Filter + summarize findings into actionable engineering decisions.
3) Only then provide executable steps / commands.

This rule is **OFFICIAL-LOCKED** and must be carried to every new window handoff pack.
